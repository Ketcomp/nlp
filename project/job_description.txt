Expertise in JavaScript, HTML and CSS/Sass
Comfortable working in a Unix Environment
Experience with both Backend and Frontend performance analysis
Understanding of web security best practice

Pluses

Not interested in diving into everything? Want a more focused role? You might also consider Front-End Engineer or Back-End Engineer.
