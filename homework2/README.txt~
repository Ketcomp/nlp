Observed Output
===============

	For the case 1 : No smoothing applied
	*************************************
	Sentence 1
	The probability of sentence  is ZERO
	Sentence 2
	The probability of sentence  is ZERO

	For add-one smoothing:
	**********************
	Sentence 1
	The probability of sentence is: 1.1127138196294231e-30
	Sentence 2
	The probability of sentence is: 1.3198046544502351e-30

	The most probable sentence is Sentence 2

	For Good-Turing smoothing:
	**********************
	The probability of sentence 1 is: 0.0014931485853328789
	The probability of sentence 2 is: 4.351920021369026e-07

	The most probable sentence is Sentence 1
